# Member
Create a function that takes in a list and an element, and checks whether 
that element is a member of that list. For example, 
```haskell
member [1,2,3] 3
```
should return true.

# Bubble Sort
Create a function that sorts a list based on buble sort. To understand the 
algorithm [see this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). For example,
```haskell
bsort [1,4,3,1,5,5,2,3,30]
```
should return 
```haskell
[1,1,2,3,3,4,5,5,30]
```

# Duplicate Removal
Create a function that removes duplicates from a list. (Hint: You might want 
to use your implementation of bubble sort in this). For example,
```haskell
removal [1,4,3,1,5,5,2,3,30]
```
should return 
```haskell
[1,2,3,4,5,30]
```
