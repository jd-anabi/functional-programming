# **FAQ**


## *What is the purpose of this site?*
Learning a new programming language is hard. Learning a new type of programming languages is even harder. 
The purpose of this site is provide an understanding of functional programming through Haskell.

## *Ok, but what is a functional programming language?*
Most people are probably accustomed to a programming paradigm known as imperative programming, where
the computer follows a sequence of imperative statements that alter the state of the program during its
runtime. Functional programming, on the other hand, is based on function construnction, composition, and 
application, usually in a recursive manner.

## *Why Haskell?*
Haskell is one of the most popular types of programming languages used for teaching functional programming; it
is a strictly functional programming language, which makes it well-suited for our needs.
