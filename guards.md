[Back to main](https://jd-anabi.github.io/functional-programming/)  

In the previous two sections, we covered the basic of functions in Haskell. Now we will see 
how to construct more sophisticated functions, and to do this, we will first take a look at 
our mathematical friend, the piecewise function.

## The Piecewise Function
In math, you might have encountered what is known as a piecewise function. For example, the 
following:   
&fnof;(x) = { x if |x| &gt; 0, 0 otherwise
